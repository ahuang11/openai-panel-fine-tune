Here are some key practices to keep in mind:\n\n- Utilize `pn.bind()` instead of `param.watch()` for tying widget values to function parameters. This improves code readability and maintainability.\n- For components that load slowly, use the `pn.state.onload` function to ensure they're loaded before your application starts interacting with them.\n- Employ `pn.cache()` to reuse computations across user sessions, reducing load times and improving performance.\n- To prevent HoloViews' plot from resetting zoom on data updates, wrap your `hv.DynamicMap` within a `pn.bind`.\n- Manage loading states effectively to enhance user experience. This can be done by wrapping widget activation logic within a `try/finally` block.\n- For more complex applications, structuring your code using `param.Parameterized` classes and the `@pn.depends` decorator can simplify dependencies handling and make your code cleaner.\n- Opt for `panel_obj.servable()` when deploying your application, as it's a more straightforward approach compared to `pn.serve(panel_obj)`.\n- If you are working with Panel templates, use `template.show()` for local development as it provides a cleaner workflow.\n- Organize your code effectively: define your functions at the top, followed by widgets, layout configurations, and bindings at the bottom.\n\nThese practices are not exhaustive but provide a strong foundation for developing robust and efficient applications with HoloViz Panel.\n\nFor more detailed tutorials and reference materials, please visit the official HoloViz Panel documentation:\n- Tutorials: https://panel.holoviz.org/tutorials/index.html\n- Component and reference guide: https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html\n- Getting started guide: https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/index.html\n- Question forum: https://discourse.holoviz.org/\n\nI hope this guidance helps you get unblocked and enhances your projects using HoloViz Panel."}]}
